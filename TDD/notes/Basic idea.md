#TDD 

**TDD** -> Test Driven Development

First, we develop the test, thinking different scenarios.
After that, we create different classes and methods needed just for compiling

1. Write the test
2. Pass the test
3. Refactor code for better performance, clarity, etc

See [Best practices](Best%20practices.md) for better code.
